I'm currently a first year master's student at Utrecht University studying Game and Media Technology. Previously I studied at Technical University Eindhoven, Hogeschool Utrecht and have done internships at [VicarVision](https://www.vicarvision.nl/) and [Sentient Information systems](https://www.sentient.nl/). I enjoy working on real time systems such as computer vision, graphics or machine learning. 

In my spare time I enjoy bouldering, programming, calisthenics, cooking and playing/analyzing games.

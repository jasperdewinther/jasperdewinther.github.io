For the first time, I could work on a ray tracer with the help of a very good and dedicated lecturer, namely Jacco Bikker. During the course, we first implemented a Whitted style ray tracer (on the CPU). I was pleasantly surprised with the performance, as I thought nothing could be rendered (let alone ray traced) on the CPU.</description></item></channel></rss>

For the first time, I could work on a ray tracer with the help of a very good and dedicated lecturer, namely Jacco Bikker. During the course, we first implemented a Whitted style ray tracer (on the CPU). I was pleasantly surprised with the performance, as I thought nothing could be rendered (let alone ray traced) on the CPU.</description></item><item><title>Voxels</title><link>https://jasperdewinther.github.io/posts/voxels/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jasperdewinther.github.io/posts/voxels/</guid><description>As quite some people do, I got inspired by John Lin&amp;rsquo;s voxel engine and thus, got started researching how voxels work. At first, I started with a meshing based approach similar to minecraft and got some basic lighting going. One of the first real issues I encountered was with transparency, as I did not have much experience with graphics I did not realize it would be such a hassle to render transparent water for example.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://jasperdewinther.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jasperdewinther.github.io/about/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m currently a first year master&amp;rsquo;s student at Utrecht University, studying Game and Media Technology. Previously I studied at Technical University Eindhoven, HU University of Applied Sciences and have done internships at VicarVision and Sentient Information systems. I enjoy working on real time systems such as computer vision, graphics or machine learning.
In my spare time I enjoy bouldering, programming, calisthenics, cooking and playing/analyzing games.</description></item><item><title>Contact</title><link>https://jasperdewinther.github.io/contact/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jasperdewinther.github.io/contact/</guid><description>You can contact find me in the following places:

For the first time I could work on a ray tracer with the help of a very good and dedicated lecturer, namely Jacco Bikker. During the course we first implemented a Whitted style raytracer (on the CPU). I was pleasantly surprised with the performance as I thought nothing could be rendered (let alone ray traced) on the CPU.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://jasperdewinther.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jasperdewinther.github.io/about/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m currently a first year master&amp;rsquo;s student at Utrecht University studying Game and Media Technology. Previously I studied at Technical University Eindhoven, Hogeschool Utrecht and have done internships at VicarVision and Sentient Information systems. I enjoy working on real time systems such as computer vision, graphics or machine learning.
